= Systems building

An extensible language for describing and configuring systems.

== Semantics

See my tomboy notes on puppet semantics, and more correct semantics

== Implementation

=== Resource collectors

Resource collectors, a way to realize resources together.
Could be used to realize all package constraints in one aptitude call.
Detects incompatible constraints, and is faster.

Dependencies between collected items can be handled like so:
A, B, C packages, B depends on A.
Step 1: collector realizes {A, C}
Step 2: collector realizes {A, C, B}

== Tools
