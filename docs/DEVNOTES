= Systems building

An extensible language for describing and configuring systems.

== Semantics

See my tomboy notes on puppet semantics, and more correct semantics

== Implementation

=== Resource collectors

Resource collectors, a way to realize resources together.
Could be used to realize all package constraints in one aptitude call.
Detects incompatible constraints, and is faster.

Dependencies between collected items can be handled like so:
A, B, C packages, B depends on A.
Step 1: collector realizes {A, C}
Step 2: collector realizes {A, C, B}

== Tools

Find relevant libraries

=== Graphs

A graph data-structure

Candidates
* python-networkx
* http://code.google.com/p/python-graph/

Rejected
* kjbuckets
* boost bindings
* graphviz-based

=== Templating

Generating config files

Candidates (as of intrepid)
* python-jinja2
* python-ll-core ll.ul4c — http://www.livinglogic.de/Python/ul4c/Howto.html

Rejected due to trusted templates (arbitrary reason to cull the list):
* python-empy
* python-ll-core ll.xpit
* python-mako
* python-tempita — http://pythonpaste.org/tempita/

Rejected due to lack of expressiveness (no tests):
* string.Template — http://docs.python.org/library/string.html#template-strings

Rejected
* python-cheetah (mostly html-centric)
* python-jinja (superceded by python-jinja2)
* python-myghty (superceded by python-mako)
* python-nevow (html-centric)

=== Grammar

Parsing a DSL.

For now, a façade API in python is enough.

SDF may be worth investigating.
It is supported by the environments ASF+SDF and StrategoXT.

PyMeta would also work and is simple.

=== Miscellany

Type traits
* python-enthought-traits

== Deploying

# Package not deployed locally as that would interfere with testing.
debuild --no-tgz-check -us -uc -i -I; scp ../python-systems_0.1_all.deb tefal.local: ; ssh -t tefal.local 'sudo dpkg -i python-systems_0.1_all.deb'

== Troubleshooting

What is causing that unexpected "141" output?
sudo PYTHONPATH=lib python -u -m trace --trace --ignore-dir /usr:/var test/test_building.py

sudo PYTHONPATH=lib strace -fF -etrace=process,file,write -ostrace python test/test_building.py; sed -i '/stat/d' strace
